## Project Introduction:
While states continue to change policies pertaining to statewide shutdowns, reopenings, mask restrictions, etc., data collected hopefully show how effective these policies were relative to the number of positive cases. We want to compare a few different states on when these policies were enacted and how effective they were with flattening the curve.


## Research Question:
 How effective have state policies been on reducing the number of cases or growth rates?

## Approach:
We plan on using supervised learning methods such as logistic regression to calculate the likelihood of infection occurring based on states policy implications. We can also use a linear regression to predict the potential number of cases per state based on similar features. Finally, we could consider clustering the states together based on similarities in their policy.

     Data understanding and EDA

     Date Preparation

     Machine Learning (if applicable - supervised, unsupervised)

     Evaluation

## Known Issues:
One known issue is finding states that reported on similar data so we can ensure that the comparisons made are accurate. 

## Conclusion:
